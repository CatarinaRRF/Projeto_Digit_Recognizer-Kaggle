* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning

### Technologies 
* Python
* Google Colab
* Python libraries: Pandas, Nunphy, matplot.lib, seaborn
* SKLearn

## Project Description

The data was obtained through the company's API and we were asked to analyze it to define the reasons for the high churn of customers. Thus, it was raised through the initial treatment of these data that the churm hypothesis may be coming from the . 

`-What hypothesis you are exploring. 
-What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? 
-What blockers and challenges are you facing?`

## Needs of this project

- Tips in data exploration/descriptive statistics
- Tips in processing/cleaning
